# FuZe Forensic Debug Pipeline

## Current State Assessment

### System Status: BROKEN - Infinite Loop
The forensic pipeline is stuck in an infinite loop generating the same hardcoded fixes repeatedly instead of addressing actual problems.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **All .rs scripts contain hardcoded logic** for the original ollama cleanup problem
2. **Scripts don't read dynamic input** - they generate static output regardless of actual issues
3. **Fix plan generator ignores re-do.txt** and always produces the same 5 fixes
4. **sed commands use append (a\) instead of replace** causing file corruption with duplicate lines

### Evidence of Hardcoded Bullshit
- `test-fuckups.rs`: Hardcoded analysis of `/FuZe/ollama` paths and specific model patterns
- `analyze-my-fuckedup-analysis.rs`: Generates fixed RCA templates regardless of input
- `fix-plan.rs`: Contains static list of 5 issues that are always "found"
- `debugging-plan.rs`: Generates same debugging commands every time

### Current Problem Being Ignored
**Path Resolution Issue**: `cracker.sh` path has double `/LLM/LLM/` instead of `/LLM/` in `refine-and-bake-ollama-gpt-oss-20b-std.sh`

### Fix Strategy
1. **Isolate in fixshit/ directory** for safe refactoring
2. **Make scripts read problem_statement.input** instead of hardcoded analysis
3. **Generate dynamic fixes** based on actual problems, not templates
4. **Test each script individually** before integrating back

### Progress
- âœ… Created fixshit/ isolation directory
- âœ… Copied original scripts for safe modification
- âœ… Identified the infinite loop cause
- ðŸ”„ Working on dynamic problem statement parsing

### Next Steps
Use forensics to actually investigate the path resolution issue instead of running the broken infinite loop pipeline.
