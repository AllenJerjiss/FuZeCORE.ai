=== ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - INITIAL FINDINGS ===

CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

1. DIRECTORY MIGRATION TIMELINE:
   Q: When did /FuZe/models/ollama stop being used?
   Q: What triggered the move to /FuZe/ollama?
   Q: Are there any lingering references to the old path?
   Q: Why is /FuZe/baked/ollama empty but exists?

2. SERVICE CONFIGURATION INCONSISTENCIES:
   Q: Why are all ollama services inactive?
   Q: What was the last known working service configuration?
   Q: Are GPU assignments (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES) correctly mapped?
   Q: Do service files point to correct model directories?

3. MODEL NAMING CONVENTION EVOLUTION:
   Q: Why do we have both gpu0 and 3090ti patterns?
   Q: What was the exact sequence of renaming operations?
   Q: Are there orphaned models with old naming?
   Q: Do cleanup scripts handle mixed naming patterns?

4. CLEANUP SCRIPT MODIFICATION RISKS:
   Q: What would happen if service-cleanup.sh runs with wrong MODELDIR?
   Q: Could store-cleanup.sh migrate models to non-existent directories?
   Q: Will cleanup-variants.sh regex miss existing model patterns?
   Q: What safeguards exist against data loss?

5. SYSTEM STATE VALIDATION:
   Q: Are there active ollama processes not managed by systemd?
   Q: What disk space issues might exist with 1TB+ models?
   Q: Are there permission issues preventing service startup?
   Q: Do network ports conflict between service instances?

RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Validate all service configurations before enabling
2. Test cleanup scripts in dry-run mode first
3. Backup all model data before running cleanup operations
4. Verify model naming consistency across all services
5. Check disk space and permissions before model operations
