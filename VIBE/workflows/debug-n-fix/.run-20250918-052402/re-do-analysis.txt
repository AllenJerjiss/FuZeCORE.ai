Analyzing test results and determining next action

# 1. ANALYZING TEST RESULTS
Running test-applied-fix.rs to get current status...
Test execution completed

# 2. DETERMINING ACTION BASED ON TEST RESULTS
STATUS: Tests failed - Need to re-run forensic analysis
REASON: Script execution failed, likely due to path issues
ERROR CONTEXT: Path resolution issue: cracker.sh path has double /LLM/LLM/ instead of /LLM/

# 3. TRIGGERING NEW FORENSIC ANALYSIS RUN
Starting run-test-fuckups.sh with updated context...
Problem statement for new run:
FOLLOW-UP FORENSIC ANALYSIS:
Previous cleanup script fixes were applied but testing revealed:
- Path resolution issue: cracker.sh path has double /LLM/LLM/ instead of /LLM/
- Original cleanup issues appear resolved
- New issue: Path resolution in refine-and-bake-ollama-gpt-oss-20b-std.sh

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
1. Why is the script looking for cracker.sh at wrong path
2. Path resolution logic in main script
3. Fix the double /LLM/LLM/ path issue

✓ Problem statement written to 're-do.txt' file
✓ Ready for manual forensic pipeline execution
