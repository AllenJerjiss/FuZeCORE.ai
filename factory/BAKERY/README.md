placehoder for the bakery where we will:

take a refinery's recepie and bake a product out of it.  it could be for example a 

1.  CORE product - a vanilla LLM-FuZe (finetuned to a certain FuZe-hardware setup for it)
2
2.  RRLM ()




take the best option for running the model that comes out of the refinery and apply:
LORa to fine tune it for a perticular persona, and produce the fine-tuned model that results as FuZe-persona-<...model-name
