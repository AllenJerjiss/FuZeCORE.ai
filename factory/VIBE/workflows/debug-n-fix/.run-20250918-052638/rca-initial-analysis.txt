=== ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS - INITIAL FINDINGS ===

CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR RE-DO ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

1. PATH RESOLUTION ANALYSIS:
   Q: Why is there a double /LLM/LLM/ in the path?
   Q: Where is the path concatenation logic going wrong?
   Q: Is this happening in refine-and-bake-ollama-gpt-oss-20b-std.sh?
   Q: Are there multiple path variables being combined incorrectly?

2. CRACKER.SH LOCATION ANALYSIS:
   Q: What is the correct path to cracker.sh?
   Q: Is the script looking for it in the wrong directory?
   Q: Has the directory structure changed since the script was written?

3. SCRIPT PATH LOGIC VALIDATION:
   Q: How does the main script determine the path to cracker.sh?
   Q: Are there hardcoded paths that need updating?
   Q: Is this a relative vs absolute path issue?

4. PREVIOUS FIX VALIDATION:
   Q: Which cleanup script issues were actually resolved?
   Q: Are there any remaining cleanup script problems?
   Q: Do the original fixes need reverting due to new issues?

IDENTIFIED FAILURES FROM FORENSIC ANALYSIS:
   FAILURE: ✗ Path resolution - double /LLM/LLM/ construction
   FAILURE: ✗ cracker.sh location - incorrect path lookup
   FAILURE: ✗ refine-and-bake-ollama-gpt-oss-20b-std.sh path logic

UNRECOGNIZED PATTERNS DETECTED:
   UNKNOWN: ? Path concatenation creating /LLM/LLM/ instead of /LLM/
   UNKNOWN: ? cracker.sh expected location vs actual location mismatch

RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR RE-DO:
1. Locate the exact source of double /LLM/LLM/ path construction
2. Verify the correct path to cracker.sh in current directory structure
3. Fix path resolution logic in refine-and-bake script
4. Test path resolution with corrected logic
