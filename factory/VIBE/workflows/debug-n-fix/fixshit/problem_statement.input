FOLLOW-UP FORENSIC ANALYSIS:
Previous cleanup script fixes were applied but testing revealed:
- Path resolution issue: cracker.sh path has double /LLM/LLM/ instead of /LLM/
- Original cleanup issues appear resolved
- New issue: Path resolution in refine-and-bake-ollama-gpt-oss-20b-std.sh

INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
1. Why is the script looking for cracker.sh at wrong path
2. Path resolution logic in main script
3. Fix the double /LLM/LLM/ path issue
