fluid catalytic cracker...fcc..example:

havier fractions of cruid oil -> lighter products
crude oid -> distillation (bubble up and seperate based on poiling points for example )  you get some initial stuff, but then run them through vaccum distullation -> fcc -> oil -> gasoliine and other more valuable fuels

material:  heavy crude oil -> (distillatiopn process) -> initial valuable stuff [set aside] -> (valuable that haven't seperated) -> cracker (fcc)

refinery -> distillation -> break down :  -> set aside.
for desired output product -> cracker -> fcc -> gasoline....
